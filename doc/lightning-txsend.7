.SH NAME
lightning-txsend - Command to sign and send transaction from txprepare
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtxsend\fR \fItxid\fR [\fIannotate\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBtxsend\fR RPC command signs and broadcasts a transaction created by
\fBtxprepare\fR\.


The \fItxid\fR is the transaction to be signed and broadcasted\.


The \fIannotate\fR is either of the below strings:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
"": No annotation\.
.IP \[bu]
"withdraw": Record the transaction as being a withdrawal from the
internal wallet\.

.RE
.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an object with attributes \fItx\fR and \fItxid\fR will be returned\.


\fItx\fR represents the fully signed raw bitcoin transaction, and \fItxid\fR is
the same as the \fItxid\fR argument\.


On failure, an error is reported (from bitcoind), and the inputs from
the transaction are unreserved\.


The following error codes may occur:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
-32602: Parameter error\.
If this error is returned, the inputs to the transaction remain
reserved (since the error is an error in parameters, \fBlightningd\fR
might not even know what transaction you are passing in)\.
.IP \[bu]
-1: Catchall nonspecific error\.
